Data Analysis

Download mole fraction c02 and temperature data (graph.csv), as well as the temp_co2.py file. Change the hardcoded paths to the datasets in order for it to work. Check 'import' statements for dependencies, will list them here later. 

Should output an image mapping the temperature values with the c02 concentration increase with some text with values/questions.

Very basic, in the works project.
